Personal Projects developed by David Waters.

All projects are subjects that interest me and created entirely by me.

-- Minesweeper Clone --
A clone of the minesweeper game written in C++ using the olcConsoleGameEngine.h
game engine developed by javidx9 (All credit to javidx9 for the game engine).

This clone includes basic graphics, also created by David Waters, and has a simple
size selection for the grid of tiles. Currently, game plays correctly and allows
user to play again if they lose or win the game.

More features to come! (Such as varying map size, sound, etc.)

Game still in development -- if you are seeing this now, please wait no longer than
about a week and there will be a working upload on GitHub. Your patience is appreciated.
