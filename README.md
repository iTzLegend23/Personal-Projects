-- Minesweeper Clone --
A clone of the minesweeper game written in C++ using the olcConsoleGameEngine.h
game engine developed by javidx9 (All credit to javidx9 for the game engine).

This clone includes basic graphics, also created by David Waters, and is still in development.
As such, there are some bugs that are still being worked out. Your patience is appreciated.

More features to come! (Such as varying map size, sound, etc.)
